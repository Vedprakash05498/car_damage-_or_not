# Machine Learning Model Performance Visualization

This repository contains code for visualizing the performance of a machine learning model during training. The code leverages Keras and TensorFlow to train and evaluate models, with a focus on visualizing the training process, including accuracy and loss metrics for both the training and validation datasets.

## Libraries and Dependencies

The following libraries are required for the project:

- `os`: For interacting with the operating system.
- `h5py`: For reading and writing HDF5 files.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `json`: For parsing JSON data.
- `urllib.request`: For fetching data from the internet.
- `matplotlib`: For plotting graphs.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation.
- `seaborn`: For enhanced data visualization.
- `IPython`: For displaying images and managing output.
- `scikit-learn`: For machine learning utilities.
- `kagglehub`: For interacting with Kaggle datasets.
- `keras` and `tensorflow`: For building and training deep learning models.

## Key Functions

### `plot_metrics`

This function is designed to visualize the performance metrics (accuracy and loss) of a machine learning model during training. It takes two arguments:

- `hist`: A dictionary-like object, typically a Keras `History` object, containing the training and validation accuracy and loss metrics recorded during the training process.
- `stop`: The number of epochs to display on the plots (defaults to 50).

The function will generate a plot with two subplots:
- **Accuracy**: Displays the training and validation accuracy over the epochs.
- **Loss**: Displays the training and validation loss over the epochs.

```python
def plot_metrics(hist, stop=50):

    axes[0].set_title('Accuracy')
    axes[0].set_ylabel('Accuracy')
    axes[0].set_xlabel('Epoch')
    axes[0].legend(loc='lower right')

    axes[1].plot(range(stop), hist['loss'], label='Training', color='#FF533D')

    plt.tight_layout()

    print("Best Model:")
    print_best_model_results(hist)

### Notes:
- Adjust the code snippets and dependencies as per your exact environment and requirements.
- If you have a `requirements.txt` file, you can include it with all necessary dependencies for easy installation.
